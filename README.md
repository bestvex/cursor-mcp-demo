# Cursor MCP GitHub Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration between Cursor IDE and GitHub using the Model Control Protocol (MCP).

## What is Cursor?

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-powered code editor built on top of VS Code that helps developers write, understand, and improve code faster with AI assistance.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Control Protocol) is a protocol that allows Cursor to connect to custom AI models or third-party services like GitHub. With MCP, you can:

- Create and manage GitHub repositories directly from Cursor
- Push code changes to GitHub
- Create issues and pull requests
- Fork repositories
- And much more!

## Setting up GitHub MCP in Cursor

To set up GitHub MCP in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
2. Navigate to AI Settings
3. Find the MCP Servers section
4. Add a new server for GitHub
5. Configure authentication (usually with a GitHub token)
6. Save and start using GitHub features directly from Cursor

## Benefits of GitHub MCP Integration

- Streamlined workflow: Manage your code and GitHub repositories without leaving your editor
- AI-assisted GitHub operations: Use Cursor's AI to help with commit messages, issue descriptions, etc.
- Improved productivity: Reduce context switching between your editor and GitHub

## Example Use Cases

- Creating new repositories
- Pushing code changes
- Managing issues
- Creating and reviewing pull requests
- Searching GitHub code and repositories
